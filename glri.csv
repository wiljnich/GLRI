These previously identified infestations will also be re-surveyed to track the spread and density of these sites. If the native weevil in watermilfoil control proves successful then a secondary metric of 2.2.1 - Number of acres controlled by GLRI-funded projects (cumulative) will be added and reported in EAGL. Although SLBE waterbodies have several vulnerabilities to AIS infestation, two seasons of intensive monitoring of 16 park water bodies for seven regionally targeted AIS have produced encouraging results. While several of SLBE’s water bodies do have an AIS infestation, the majority do not.

As part of a framework, which includes both measurement and prediction of water quality in the nearshore, this project will provide the monitoring information to aid in characterization and transport of phosphorus and other nutrients, the formation and growth of harmful algal blooms, near real-time detection of particulate microcystins using an Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) as well as provide the information necessary to assess target loads in agricultural watersheds. This framework will connect land-based phosphorus reductions efforts to changes in in-lake nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton communities, provide important baseline measurements which can be used to assess long-term impacts of land-based phosphorus remediation efforts.

The goals of this project will be to (i) carry out in situ monitoring of pollutants (e.g. harmful algae) and (ii) determine pollutant transport through the nearshore zone, (iii) quantify transport of runoff (nutrients, algae, etc.) and impacts to nearshore health.  In support of Objective 3.2, in situ measurement sites will be coordinated with local, state, private, and federal partners and established in the nearshore zone. Nearshore sites will measure nutrients, conductivity, and other parameters (e.g. algae) as well as hydrodynamic variables (e.g. currents, waves, sediment). A linked modeling framework will be developed that consists of hydrologic inputs, hydrodynamic forecasting, and pollutant transport. Runoff from the watershed will be acquired from observed and modeled conditions and coupled to a nearshore hydrodynamic model that will provide transport of pollutants at tributary and beach scales.

NOAA,2016,"$29,824 ",New Project,Development of a sandwich hybridization assay to detect microcystis for use on the Environmental Sample Processor,Dept. of Commerce-National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin.,"In order to link land-based nutrient reduction practices to reductions in the size, density and toxicity of Lake Erie harmful algal blooms, in-lake water quality measurements are critically needed. Furthermore, in order to continue to better develop HAB forecasting products (NOAA’s Lake Erie HAB Bulletin and Experimental HAB Tracker) better resolution is needed to understand the daily trends in bloom biomass and toxicity. The Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) is a fully submersible, electromechanical fluidic system designed to collect discrete water samples, concentrate particulate material, and automate application of molecular diagnostic technologies. ESP technology has been successfully used for several years to assist in the monitoring of marine HABs and their related toxins in the Pacific Northwest, California and Gulf of Maine. However, NOAA GLERL’s recently purchased ESP (EPA-GLRI FY14 funding) brings this advanced technology to the Great Lakes for the first time and will be utilized to provide near real-time concentrations of particulate microcystins on a time scale (every other day) that has never before been achieved in Lake Erie. However, the ESP can perform more than just toxin assays. The ESP can also archive samples for future analysis and conduct molecular assays to estimate quantities of organisms of interest. For the Lake Erie ESP, we propose to develop a sandwich hybridization assay (SHA) that will estimate the densities of total Microcystis either at surface (~1m) or at depth where the ESP will be located during deployment. These measurements will provide the fine-scale resolution needed to compare against satellite data as well as provide valuable information to water managers and other stakeholders who make water management decisions.",3 - Nonpoint Source Pollution Impacts on Nearshore Health,4/30/2016,3/31/2019,Multi-state,42.217,-83.7344

We developed an interactive decision support system (DSS) (http://tippingpointplanner.org), based on extensive research, as a facilitation tool for extension specialists, coastal managers, and consultants who work with land use commissions and watershed planning committees. This tool helps watershed leaders identify land-based activities that result in nutrient loading, increased runoff, nonpoint source pollution, and threaten the sustainability of ecosystems in their watershed. The tool provides a facilitated forum to explore policy and management interventions necessary to keep ecosystems from crossing a tipping point and moving to an unstable condition. Communities may use the tool to develop sustainable action plans for their watershed or community.  Our overall goal is to improve sustainable land management decision making and restoration at the sub-watershed level by targeting nutrient loading and land use practices that impact Great Lakes food webs, coastal algal blooms, and tributary fishery values. We seek to enhance the Tipping Point Planner DSS with high resolution data for nutrient sources in selected Area of Concern watersheds and with models relating nutrient sources to multiple endpoints. Our work will inform Best Management Plan (BMP) selection, location and action prioritization, and will help Sea Grant facilitators select target watersheds for facilitation and/or assistance. Deployment of our DSS and facilitation process and training of community facilitators will occur within target watersheds in Areas of Concern.  These areas have been chosen to best leverage NOAA GLERLs and our research team’s efforts to model impacts of land use change and nutrient loading on near shore health.

The results will assure that the Great Lakes community can evaluate and monitor the impact of nutrient management strategies and reduction targets as well as climate variability on harmful algal blooms in western Lake Erie, Green Bay, and Saginaw Bay.   Evaluation of our methods indicates that they are not specific to Lake Erie.  Applying them to the other bays does not require developing new algorithms, but requires only validation of product quality, in order to develop a climatology of bloom severity.  We have established a satellite-based climatology for western Lake Erie starting in 2002 using data from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS).  With the loss of MERIS in 2012, we created an interim product with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS).   We will transfer the methods to the OLCI, which will be launched by the European Space Agency in 2015 (instrument and satellite are ready now).  Unlike MODIS (which has some limitations and is also near the end of its mission life), MERIS and OLCI were designed explicitly to identify cyanobacteria and target severe blooms.  OLCI is the replacement for MERIS, and a second OLCI will be launched in 2018.   The validation with OLCI will assure that this monitoring will continue into the next decade, allowing accurate and consistent assessment of changes in bloom severity in response to nutrient management and climate variability.

Furthermore, in 2016, GLERL deployed the first 2nd Generation Environmental Sample Processor (2G ESP) for autonomous, near-real time monitoring of microcystins in a freshwater system. These efforts will help advance two of NOAA’s GLRI FA3-supported decision support tools -- the Western Lake Erie Experimental HAB Bulletin and the Western Lake Erie Experimental 3D HAB Tracker. The Bulletin will be transitioned to operations in FY17 and the HAB Tracker is scheduled for FY18 transition. While these widely adopted NOAA products provide tracking of bloom biomass, they do not fully meet the demands of regional stakeholders who call for forecasts of bloom toxicity. Furthermore, holistic understanding of bloom initiation, toxicity, and persistence in response to changes in nutrient concentrations and form is lacking. This project will help the GLRI elucidate these linkages by following the stated intention in FA3 ‘GLRI partners will assess the extent to which harmful algal blooms are impacted by phosphorus loading, in-lake mixing, climate change and invasive species. The relationship between harmful algal blooms and hypoxia will also be assessed’ (GLRI Action Plan II v.2, page 15). To further support GLERL’s weekly and near-realtime detection of HABs, and toxins, a second Environmental Sampling System identical to the currently operated by GLERL/CIGLR in western Lake Erie will constructed from component systems and mechanically tested in FY18. This ESP will ultimately be deployed near Monroe, Michigan, and like our other ESP will measure particulate microcystins and Microcystis by genetics. A second ESP will give us a better early warning system of problems by increasing spatial and temporal coverage of microcystins.

These runoff risk tools will alert producers of when not to apply nutrients to their fields assuring that they are not immediately transported into nearby waterbodies. Delaying applications before expected runoff events has economic effects on producers as well as it will eliminate the additional costs of repeat applications. This project will determine the effectiveness of runoff risk usage on water quality by comparing simulations following runoff risk guidance against baseline simulations. Partnering with Ohio State University, we will use an existing OSU SWAT model for the Maumee River watershed, to develop both the baseline (runoff and nutrient loads without application of the tool) and nutrient application scenarios that modify application behavior based on runoff risk guidance. The scenario results will be compared against the baseline, calibrated results. The scenarios will consider varying rates of farmer adoption across the watershed.

These models work well in some years but not in others. The connections between spring loading and summer bloom extent and location are not well defined or understood. Nor is the connection between nutrient loading and toxicity of the bloom well defined. A target reduction of loading of 40% has been chosen to ameliorate proliferation of HABs in Lake Erie. Will a 40% reduction in P loading achieve the goal and how important is timing of loads to managing the problem? Management of amount and timing of nutrient reduction to achieve the desired goal cannot be specified until a mechanistic understanding of the reasons for the temporal offset to loading and other factors responsible for bloom initiation, maintenance, and toxicity are better understood. A major factor that must be considered in understanding initiation, extent, location, and toxicity of HABs blooms is the role that dreissenid mussels are playing in western Lake Erie. We will use a combination of field surveys to assess dreissenid mussel abundance, seasonal condition and growth, and lab experiments to measure mussel feeding and nutrient excretion rates using Lake Erie seston and laboratory cultures to determine the impact of mussels in transforming nutrient loads into harmful algal blooms.",3 - Nonpoint Source Pollution Impacts on Nearshore Health,10/1/2017,9/30/2019,Multi-state,42.217,-83.7344

NPS,2014,"$150,000 ",Increase,Predict and prevent avian botulism outbreaks,Dept. of Interior-National Park Service ,"This project addresses dramatic nearshore ecosystem changes and continued avian botulism outbreaks at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.  A variety of monitoring, research, and outreach approaches will be employed to understand drivers of botulism outbreaks, develop mitigation tools, and better communicate research activities and findings.  In FY14 we will 1) track avian mortality via our monitoring of beaches at Sleeping Bear Dunes, 2) link nearshore environmental conditions to botulism outbreaks via our monitoring in Good Harbor Bay, 3) investigate mechanisms of botulinum toxin production and transfer, 4) develop predictive capacity, based on links between botulism outbreak severity and climate factors, 5) identify botulism outbreak mechanisms based on spatial and temporal patterns in large-scale drivers, and 6) synthesize, summarize, and report on our collective results to date.  Additionally, in FY14 we plan to increase our focus on outreach, education, and management.  We will 1) hire a term, subject-to-furlough education specialist, to integrate project findings into interpretive programming and outreach activities in the Sleeping Bear Dunes area, and 2) support a UW-Milwaukee Freshwater Sciences doctoral candidate, to better define management possibilities, constraints, and uncertainties related to avian botulism at Sleeping Bear Dunes and beyond.  In short, we plan to continue our critical monitoring and research efforts, synthesize and publish results from this ongoing research, identify the management and policy implications of this work, and communicate these implications to park visitors, the public, and Great Lakes management community.   Because the work of the UW-Milwaukee doctoral candidate is critical to the botulism project's overall success and its integration into Great Lakes management and policy, we will allocate sufficient funds to UW-Milwaukee in FY2014 to see the student through her three-year doctoral program.  The FY2014 NPS-GLRI funds will provide partial support to the candidate throughout her program (in the form of two nine-month stipends with related benefits), with the balance provided by UW-Milwaukee via a one-year university fellowship (already awarded).  The university fellowship must be spent in 2014/2015, with NPS/GLRI funds spent in subsequent academic years (2015/2016 and 2016/2017, approximately $34.5k each year).  Thus, these FY2014 GLRI funds, awarded to UWM via an existing Cooperative Agreement, may not be fully expended until partway through 2017 when the candidate completes her third and final year.  Although this arrangement requires the use of FY2014 GLRI funds in future fiscal years, it is the only way to ensure that this important work is completed regardless of GLRI’s funding future.",3 - Nonpoint Source Pollution Impacts on Nearshore Health,6/1/2014,12/31/2017,MI,44.981639,-85.830861
NPS,2017,"$120,000 ",New Project,Reduce Stormwater Flooding by Removing Station Road – Design Phase at Cuyahoga National Park,Dept. of Interior-National Park Service ,"This project would eventually remove a point source (15-inch culvert) that discharges urban runoff directly into the Cuyahoga River within that National Park boundary and also reduce urban discharge from a 48-inch culvert in the same area. FY17 funds support the design phase. Eventual implementation of the project would reroute an existing, degraded stormwater line that currently runs from a developed area under an abandoned road through Cuyahoga Valley National Park to discharge directly into the Cuyahoga River.  The discharge would be diverted into a nearby ravine which would be improved to provide regenerative-stormwater conveyance and enhanced habitat value.  The ravine currently opens onto a mowed field owned by Cleveland Metro Parks; part of the field would be converted to a stormwater-retention wetland to reduce runoff, filter pollutants, and restore floodplain functions.  After rerouting the stormwater line, the abandoned road would be depaved and planted with native vegetation to reduce runoff further. Design work will be completed through NPS using contracting procedures in partnership with Cleveland Metro Parks and the City of Brecksville.

This project also will reduce urban discharge from a 48-inch culvert located approximately 200-feet north of the 15-inch culvert. Design for this project is being completed under contract by HDR Engineering. The contract was awarded in September 2016 with schematic design and costs to be delivered in November 8,2018. Final design and construction drawings are scheduled for delivery by March 2019. This work will be accomplished by rerouting an abandoned stormwater/sewage line that continues to carry effluent from residential development under an abandoned road to discharge directly into the Cuyahoga River. The discharge will be diverted into a nearby ravine located west of Riverview Road. The condition of the degraded ravine will be improved through use of step pools and regenerative-stormwater conveyance to enhance habitat value. Stormwater carried by the ravine discharges into a downstream wetland owned by Cleveland Metroparks and designed to capture and store runoff for natural regeneration of the groundwater table. In order to retain additional runoff from this project, the retention wetland would be expanded and planted to filter pollutants, restore floodplain functions, and improve habitat values. After rerouting flow from the abandoned stormwater line, pavement from old Station Road will be removed and area will be planted with native vegetation to reduce runoff further.",3 - Nonpoint Source Pollution Impacts on Nearshore Health,12/31/2018,12/31/2023,OH,41.241667,-81.549722

This strain is highly valued in deepwater habitats of Lakes Huron and Michigan as these habitats fish populations have been underutilized by large predator fish since the collapse of these deepwater strains due to the introduction of sea lamprey in the early 1900's. They have also been found to survive very well in Lake Erie, making them the strain of choice in Region 5's lake trout restoration efforts.

Staff completed LT spawning surveys at nearshore Raynolds and Spectacle Reefs, where wild LT comprised seventy-five percent of the total catch, though total numbers were small. The proportion of wild lake trout was greater than 50% at the off-shore Six Fathom Bank and more than a dozen wild year-classes contributed to the spawning stock. These data suggest that wild fish continue to contribute to the adult stocks in Lake Huron. The increasing numbers of wild LT in Lake Huron has resulted in a decision by managers to reduce LT stocking beginning in 2018. Staff participated on the relevant Task Groups and helped develop stocking and survey plans to facilitate and evaluate rehabilitation and comply with the 2000 Consent Decree. Staff conducted population surveys at 24 sites in northern Lake Huron and processed and updated interagency data to facilitate building of populations models designed to manage harvest in 1836 treaty waters.

The project is ongoing and the created islands represent a novel ecosystem with little resemblance to historic conditions.  In 2016, a single PIPL pair nested on the restoration project and in 2017 four pairs successfully nested, indicating that the Cat Island Chain was becoming an important nesting site outside of MI. The dynamic nature of the restoration project necessitates that active habitat management be completed to maintain suitable nesting conditions and to deter potential predators from colonizing the island.  Unfortunately, information regarding important PIPL habitat areas, competitive interactions (many of the birds observed on Cat Island aren’t typically seen in the same area as PIPL), and site specific stressors is lacking, potentially creating a situation where uninformed management decisions may not be wholly beneficial to PIPL.  

The requested funds will be used to implement a research project that will address the feeding, breeding and predator-avoidance ecology of Piping Plovers at the Cat Island Restoration Project.  Results also will include observations and evidence of demographic success for other desirable species at the site. This project will provide such information through a map-based analysis of substrate changes, vegetation dynamics, and activities of Piping Plovers and other target species at two recently created “habitat islands” in the western and central cells of the 2.5 mile causeway system.  The information gained from this project will directly be used to inform management decisions at Cat Island and at other “created” or ""enhanced"" PIPL habitat sites (e.g., the St. Louis River AOC WI Point PIPL Beach Nourishment Project).",4 - Habitats and Species,8/1/2018,12/31/2020,WI,44.614132,-87.890963

NOAA,2017,"$485,000 ",New Project,Sustainable nearshore management solutions to prevent critical habitat loss at Illinois Beach State Park,Dept. of Commerce-National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin.,"Illinois Beach State Park’s (IBSP) 6.5-mile coastline is the only natural shoreline remaining in the state. The park’s dune and swale topography supports a wide range of natural communities and 64 threatened and endangered plant and animal species, including seven Federal listed species. The park also hosts more than 2.5 million annual visitors. Wave attack, longshore currents, and rapid fluctuations in lake levels are threatening the dune and wetland and nearshore aquatic habitats. Long-term (~150 year) shoreline recession rate averages 10 feet per year, the most severe rate of shoreline recession recorded along the Illinois coast (Chrzastowski and Frankie 2000). 
This project proposes a twofold approach for advancing the ability of coastal managers to defend vulnerable habitats located within Illinois Beach State Park. In Phase I (FY17) we will implement an immediate short-term solution by performing nourishment in critical areas for habitat protection, and track residence time of this material. New methods for this site, such as placing sand directly on the beach or placing a larger grain size (gravel-sized sediment) of material on the beach, will be implemented. Additionally, we will gather hydrodynamic and topographic data to link coastal geomorphic response to the physical environmental processes.  Characterizing these system dynamics will inform the design of novel and sustainable strategies for protecting habitat at Illinois Beach. In Phase II (FY18), we will continue to monitor the beach and nearshore zones of Illinois Beach State Park as well as develop models of nearshore hydrodynamics and sediment transport that will be used to create a long-term strategy for habitat protection.  The final product from this project will be a pilot project that implements the habitat protection strategy developed during this project.

NPS,2018,"$75,000 ",Continuation,Environmental DNA assessment of amphibian population health and presence in Great Lakes wetlands,Dept. of Interior-National Park Service ,"NPS Great Lakes Inventory and Monitoring Network (GLKN) will continue a partnership with a genetics lab to refine a sampling protocol for eDNA for detecting and monitoring amphibian populations. Variables investigated for influence on detection probability in include number and season of sampling, sample volume, sample storage and marker methods the increase the breadth of taxa sampled to increase diversity monitored with each field visit. An environmental DNA (eDNA) technique will be refined to allow genetic testing with genetic markers on filtered water samples to determine amphibian species presence in Great Lakes NPS wetlands. Amphibians are considered a sensitive indicator species of environmental health and amphibian occupancy data can be used to identify emerging problems and prioritize protection and restoration activities. Methods for determining amphibian population presence and abundance include visual field surveys and automated acoustic monitoring of vocalizations. Field surveys are time-intensive at the level needed to determine amphibian species presence, and vocal recognition using audio recorders is difficult to automate and only detects species that have calls. Environmental DNA sampling has been used to detect presence and monitor a large number of organisms over the last decade, particularly aquatic species. The methodology has worked very well for almost all species, including amphibians. To date, there has not been a study that has used this methodology for amphibian population monitoring in the Great Lakes area. NPS currently uses acoustical recording devices to monitor vocal amphibian populations in six Great Lakes park units. This project will use eDNA sampling that is co-located with the acoustical monitoring to verify the technique for determining the presence of amphibian species. The NPS believes that there are 24 amphibian species present in the Great Lakes coastal parks; only 14 of those can potentially be monitored using acoustical sampling. Two of the amphibian species are strictly terrestrial, but the remaining 22 species could potentially be monitored by using filtered water samples to determine the presence of species-specific DNA markers. A prior project is examining using existing target regions and primers to target metagenomic sequence information using next generation sequencing (NGS) for potential species recognition. While most of the potential species have existing sequences verified, the remaining species will have metagenomics sequence markers developed and verified from positive species samples. The objectives of the project will be to determine if an eDNA technique can give species occupancy estimates that are comparable to existing acoustical and visual survey techniques. And cost effective eDNA field sampling will likely require a field sampling procedure that does not require immediate refrigeration and rapid sample filtration, so that local staff can collect samples. Some sample preservation variations will be compared to see if they give similar species detectability found in the current, more intensive, sample handling. Apostle Islands National Lakeshore (APIS) and Sleeping Bear Dunes (SLBE will be the primary parks sampled; 33 Indiana Dunes NL (INDU) will be sampled if NPS travel budgets permit.

The current condition of Pitcher’s thistle - an endemic plant of the Great Lakes dunes - still remains largely unknown on NPS properties in Michigan. One of the largest populations of Pitcher’s thistle in the U.S. is found at SLBE. The vast majority of the U.S. population of Pitcher’s thistle in the Lake Superior basin is located within the Grand Sable Dunes of PIRO. The southernmost population is at INDU and is genetically distinct from the more northern occurrences. Given the large populations present on NPS property, the NLs are in a unique position to assist in the recovery of this species. All three NLs have invested significant resources in the restoration of the dune habitat for Pitcher’s thistle, and both INDU and PIRO have invested in assessment in the past. INDU has invested in restoration of this species through seed collection and outplanting in areas identified by USGS and NPS for augmentation. This project will continue work to complement and fill gaps in knowledge regarding the status of the thistle in Wisconsin and Michigan as well as support current restoration efforts at INDU. 17 Studies indicate that Pitcher’s thistle is in decline outside of the NLs because of factors related to predation by weevils released for biocontrol, goldfinch seed predation, increasing drought, and dune stabilization. Since the SLBE and PIRO populations were among the largest and “healthiest” at the time of listing in 1988, they were thought to buffer the species against extinction in the northern portion of its range. Managers need to know the condition of these populations for range-wide assessment and management. Similar actions as those proposed are called out in the Pitcher's thistle recovery plan released by USFWS in 2002, which requires NLs to assess status of the species, identify threats, and develop a management plan as action items for potential delisting of the specie At all three Lakeshores, 10 demography plots will be re-sampled and resulting data will be managed. As time permits, basic weevil damage surveys and mapping will be performed. At INDU, management of nursery stock and population augmentation will also occur including planting 1000 seeds.

Introductions have been made to both Chequamegon and Nicolet National Forests, however, they have had limited success. Unlike the reintroduced populations on the mainland, the Apostle Islands marten appear to be thriving. The Apostle Islands may be key in determining specific habitat requirements needed for marten to be successful and assist a statewide effort to restore this endangered mammal. This project relies on the current high level of cooperation and interest between the National Park Service, University of Wisconsin, Northland College, Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, WDNR, and Red Cliff tribe. Work begun in 2016 primarily through GLRI funding has documented the occurrence of marten
on addition islands and is revealing important information related to habitat, distribution, and island biogeography. What was thought to be an extirpated species has now been documented on seven islands. Work conducted in 2017 and 2018 enhanced our understanding of marten distribution in the park and prey availability (through small mammal surveys). Preliminary results indicate the small mammal populations are changing over time and a relationship between
the occurrence of red-backed voles (a preferred prey item of marten) and marten. ",4 - Habitats and Species,12/31/2018,12/31/2023,WI,41.15803,-81.33512
NPS,2019,"$197,460 ",Continuation,Protect and Enhance Great Lakes Coastal Habitats Including Globally Imperiled Barrens Communities,Dept. of Interior-National Park Service ,"This is a continuation of work begun in FY17 to obtain important information on fire and climate history for the rare, globally-imperiled Great Lakes Barrens and associated communities and to reintroduce fire to these communities. At Apostle Islands (APIS), Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) regarding fire in these habitats is being collected through a partner project. This information is being used to guide lakeshore managers on the use of prescribed fire to protect and enhance those lands. Pre- and post- fire monitoring will assess effectiveness of these management actions and inform future burns. Great Lakes Coast Pine Barrens community has a global conservation status of G3 – Vulnerable, and at Sleeping Bear Dunes (SLBE) the federally threatened Pitcher’s thistle may be present (NatureServe 2015). Fire dependent species such as jack pine and red pine, as well as wildlife that utilize these pines, will benefit. Additionally,
through this project, cultural fire practices are being reintroduced to APIS, enhancing tribal gathering.
At SLBE, this multi-year project aims to use fire to restore up to a total of 1,700 acres of wooded dune/swale/wetland complexes with hydrologic connection to Lake Michigan, where fuel loading and encroachment of other species threaten the composition of these communities. The area has been divided into 4 burn units. Unfavorable weather patterns have prevented prescribed burning to date at SLBE; the next attempt is scheduled for Spring 2019. Based on results of these burns at SLBE, FY19 funds will be used for either 1) reburn the previously burned unit(s) to ensure desired ecological outcomes, or 2) burning the third of four units. At APIS, FY19 funds will be used to burn approximately 45 acres of Great Lakes Barrens and associated communities (5 acres were burned in calendar year 2017), complete archeological compliance for current and future burn units, and obtain information needed to determine the age and changes over time of the Stockton tombolo. This is needed to assist in interpretation of fire history records and for management decision-making. At both Lakeshores, pre- and post- fire effects monitoring will be performed in FY19 and FY20 respectively, to document the success of the burns as well as inform future management decisions. Through collaboration, both parks will obtain important information needed to guide future management decisions. These actions will enhance and restore these high quality areas and sustain diverse, complex and interconnected habitats.",4 - Habitats and Species,12/31/2018,12/31/2023,Multi-state,44.81127013,-86.05611205

Floodplain access would be achieved through excavation of bank and removal of fill along a tapered channel up to 100 feet into the floodplain to release the river from its main channel. The project location is approximately 10,000 feet upstream of a low-head dam system in the Village of Peninsula. This site was identified in a study conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Buffalo District. This site has erosion and sedimentation along the main stem of the Cuyahoga River within CUVA. The location was identified as a site where hydraulic access could be most easily opened even at low flows, and is just upstream of the steepest portion of the river. Providing floodplain access here would dramatically reduce erosive water velocities during rain events and slow the water prior to reaching the Village of Peninsula. Re-connection of the river to its floodplain at this location also will enhance habitat quality for 105 acres of floodplain. Restoration of native vegetation within the newly created floodplain wetlands will occur through removal of exotic species and plantings of native species as needed.",4 - Habitats and Species,12/31/2018,12/31/2023,OH,41.361,-81.61

NOAA,2017,"$300,000 ",New Project,Remote Sensing of Cladophora extent and biomass for the lower Great Lakes,Dept. of Commerce-National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin.,"This project will generate updated measurements & analysis of Cladophora extent and biomass for the four lower Great Lakes. Remote sensing will be used to update the 2008-2011 lake-wide baseline maps of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) extent and biomass. These maps are needed to assist GLWQA Annex 4 in establishing scientifically defensible phosphorus targets to minimize Cladophora in Lake Erie and elsewhere in the Great Lakes; the SAV monitoring will compliment efforts to measure and model Cladophora responses to current ecological and nutrient loading conditions at multiple locations where nuisance conditions exist. Together, this information is of critical importance to improve capabilities of water quality managers to predict Cladophora growth in response to nearshore phosphorus loadings.
The native, filamentous green alga Cladophora is one of the most common nuisance species in the Great Lakes (Auer et al. 2010). Under favorable conditions, this benthic alga can achieve dense growth on bedrock, cobble and other suitable hard substrates in the nearshore zone where sufficient light can reach the lake bottom (Hecky et al. 2004).  The prolific growth of Cladophora and other submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) fouls beaches and water intakes, impacting human and wildlife health, aesthetics, regional economics and other ecosystem services provided by the Lakes (Higgins et al. 2008).
Satellite remote sensing offers the ability to not only identify Cladophora colonies and other SAV beds (Shuchman et al. 2013) in the Great Lakes, but also the capacity to observe changes in spatial distribution over time (Brooks et al. 2015).  Satellite derived Great Lakes basin-wide (excluding Lake Superior) SAV distribution maps corresponding to 2008-2011 vegetative season (April-September) were previously funded under GLRI.  Additionally, SAV growth trends (five year intervals) were produced for several select locations throughout the Great Lakes, indicating significant increases in SAV areal extent from 1975-2011 (Brooks et al. 2015). 
Several new satellite platforms (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, OLCI) have recently been deployed and possess the spatial and spectral characteristics to map Cladophora and other SAV in the Great Lakes. These new systems can provide continuity with existing satellite derived mapping products as well as offer the potential to better estimate biomass, a critical component into sloughing prediction models. We propose to utilize these new sensing platforms to generate an updated present day Great Lakes (excluding Lake Superior) basin-wide assessment of Cladophora and other SAV distribution.

This project will allow for purchasing equipment to measure water levels and will leverage the existing CO-OPS gauge inventory intended for use in the Great Lakes.  This project will support the installation of those gauges at the most significant locations in the Great Lakes as determined by a prioritization that incorporates rates of vertical motion, input from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the EPA AOC program. This project leverages the Federal effort and allows for collection of data in small harbors and ports. Present base funds only allow for the use of the existing water level network, leaving small ports and harbors without an accurately measured updated datum. 
An accurate Great Lakes wide elevation reference datum is a fundamental requirement for monitoring change in Great Lakes land and water levels and for providing a geospatial foundation for marine spatial planning.  Additionally, an accurate datum supports effective restoration projects, mapping, dredging, international water regulation and power generation, resource management plans, and more.  The IGLD is updated every 25-35 years due to glacial isostatic adjustment and varying rates of vertical movement in the Lakes region.

Monitoring and research activities conducted via GLRI-90a (“Nearshore monitoring in Great Lakes national Parks”) and GLRI-91 (“Research Lake Michigan Ecosystem Changes - Botulism Type E”) have served to document and understand many of these changes. Results from this body of work have been shared publicly via scientific publications and presentations, intensive citizen science efforts, media outreach and press coverage, and a significant NPS interpretive effort via GLRI-90 (“Place-Based Learning about Great Lakes National Parks”). Collectively, this work has highlighted the central role of dreissenid mussels in facilitating recent nearshore problems. NPS and partners will conduct a meso-scale dreissenid mussel removal experiment at Good Harbor Reef (Sleeping Bear Dunes) and evaluate the potential for such adaptive management actions to improve nearshore health. Dreissenid mussels will be manually removed from an experimental plot near the Good Harbor nearshore monitoring station, which will be used as a control site. Approximately 40 m2 of rocky substrate was cleared in 2016 as part of a pilot effort; in 2017 this area will be maintained and expanded. NPS, university, and agency partners will test the effectiveness of dreissenid removal in 1) reducing nuisance algal growth, algal biomass, and round goby abundance, 2) abating conditions that facilitate botulism outbreaks, and 3) improving habitat conditions for native fish.

Tree canopy cover in the United States is declining. And bare-root trees that are held over summer in gravel beds may be the most economical and effective planting method for establishment of 25 trees, and ultimate projections of tree canopy cover in 30 years. Tree canopy cover helps protect water bodies from stormwater runoff and nutrient loading. The greatest selection of species and varieties is via bare-rooted plant materials in the spring. However, the optimum timing for tree planting initiatives in the upper Midwest is in the autumn when the pressure for dutiful irrigation is less. A number of variables will be compared with non-Great Lake gravel bed sites and planting methods to assess which variables are critically important or improve the likelihood of tree survival, likely establishment and likelihood of each planting type (bare-root, container, ball/burlap) in providing canopy cover in 30 years. Western Lake Superior: Four communities on the north shore of Minnesota (Duluth, Hermantown, Silver Bay and Grand Marais) will begin their tree canopy planting initiatives in the spring of 2018.

The work done by this project provides managers with forecasting tools for predicting the combined effects of climate and land use changes that will help them identify and prioritize the sites best suited  for restoration efforts.     USGS scientists will use remote-sensing data to establish a baseline understanding of current distributions of invasive wetland plants and then forecast potential invasion corridors.  Alterations to the Great Lakes shoreline or water-level patterns associated with global climate change could have significant impacts on the extent and composition of coastal habitat.  Low lake levels can expose fertile wetland bottomlands to invasive species such as common reed (Phragmites).    ,5 - Foundations for Future Restoration Actions,7/1/2013,9/30/2017,Multi-state,43.089952,-89.519348
